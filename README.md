## Client Brief:

The Raptors have hired you to help give back to this dedicated fan base. Recently, The Raptors partnered with McDonald's to give a free medium fries to fans when the team scores 12 or more three pointers. 

The Raptors want you to create an application that clearly shows the fans if the team has scored enough three pointers so that everyone can take part in this amazing deal.

If you have time, the Raptors would love if you included an area in the app showcasing when they will next be playing as well so that their fan base can stay engaged, and always know when free fries may be in their future.
